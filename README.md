# Mental Health Prediction
 
 1. Project Description
 
Mental health costs in the US are continuously rising since 2010 and are expected to double by the year
2030. Mental health thus, is of extreem importance.This project is a kaggle dataset titled " Mental health
in Tech Survey". This dataset is a survey conducted in 2014 by the Open Sourcing Mental illness (OSMI)
to monitor mental health disorders in the Tech industry. OSMI is a non-profit organization and their aim is
to help people in the tech industry with mental health disorders so they have a good work life balance.

  2.Project Goal
  
Our idea behind choosing this dataset is identifying the people who need to seek mental health care in
the tech industry and, what are the factorsthat are contributing to the increase in mental health problems
in the industry? In todayâ€™s fast paced world there are many reasons for mental health issues and they
often result in poor work-life balance. Thus, actions are needed to be taken by companies by providing
assistance with mental health care and having a good environment and work life for better performance of
their employees. We are also curious to see if the factors like gender, age or employees with family history
are more susceptible to having mental health disorder? Our goal for the project is to find the answers to
these interesting questions.
